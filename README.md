#Some Solutions to 99 Scala Problems

These are some solutions to the Scala problems available at http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/.
I found that working on some of these problems was a nice way to add additional practice to the Scala coursera courses.  
Not all of the solutions are my own, but most of them are.
